By bringing such data and metadata together in one central location, the database supports macroeconomic analysis and cross-country comparison.

While central government is identified as the area where there is the most important key of macroeconomic analysis, the public sector debt database provides data on other levels of public sector, valuation methods and debt instruments, and clearly defined tiers of debt where appropriate for central, state and local government as well as extra-budgetary agencies and funds.","http://databank.worldbank.org/data/views/variableselection/selectvariables.aspx?source=public-sector","Time series","English","Quarter","WLD, EAP, ECA, LAC, MNA, SAS, SSA, HIC, LMY, IBRD, IDA","National","","98.0","","Economic Policy & External Debt, Public Sector","Quarterly","January, April, July, October","41486.0","rdipplesman@imf.org, ilevent@worldbank.org, erucaj@worldbank.org","Bulk download, Query tool","QPSD (Excel)=http://go.worldbank.org/VRE8SLA9T0=excel","1.0","Public Sector Debt Statistics, The World Bank","","http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/quarterly-public-sector-debt","1995 - 2012","http://data.worldbank.org/developers"

Migration to Western Europe remains largely from elsewhere in Europe.

"89.0","Corporate Scorecard Indicators","CSC","The Corporate Scorecard is designed to provide a snapshot of the Bank’s overall performance, including its business modernization, in the context of development results. It facilitates strategic dialogue between Management and the Board on progress made and areas that need attention.  The World Bank has systems—on which it continuously improves—for measuring and monitoring both development results and its own performance. These systems are complemented by independent evaluations. With the Results Measurement System, which was adopted for the 13th replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA13) in 2002, the Bank became the first multilateral development institution to use a framework with quantitative indicators to monitor results and performance. The Corporate Scorecard expands this approach to the entire World Bank covering both the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and IDA.  The Corporate Scorecard uses an integrated results and performance framework, which is organized in a four-tier structure that groups indicators along the results chain (see “Summary of the Corporate Scorecard” ). Two of the tiers track elements of development results (Tiers I and II), and the other two capture elements of performance (Tiers III and IV). As the Summary shows, the Corporate Scorecard monitors, at an aggregate level, whether the Bank is functioning efficiently and adapting itself successfully (Tier IV), and whether it is managing its operations and services effectively (Tier III) to support countries in achieving results (Tier II) in the context of global development progress and priorities (Tier I). It presents a high-level view and is not intended to provide country- or activity-level information.

The Service Delivery Indicators project is a new Africa-wide initiative that tracks service delivery in education and health across countries and over time. The project collects nationally representative data that focus mainly on performance and quality of service delivery in primary schools and at frontline health facilities. This partnership between the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the African Economic Research Consortium brings together development economists and sector specialists. The objective is to reposition the dialogue on human development in Africa within the context of effectiveness of public spending and accountability for service delivery. Why such an agenda? Accountability for public resources: developing country governments allocate roughly a third of budgets to education and health. Demands for accountability for the efficient use of public resources—from citizens and tax payers in developed or developing countries alike—are gaining in prominence, in part, because of the global economic situation. Accountability depends upon measurement: without consistent and accurate information on the quality of services, it is difficult for citizens or politicians to assess how service providers are performing, to work towards corrective action, and ultimately bring about improvements. There is little robust and representative evidence of what teachers and health workers do during a typical work-day, their levels of ability, knowledge and skills, how teachers perform their teaching activities and how well health workers diagnose and treat their patients.","http://databank.worldbank.org/data/source/service-delivery-indicators","Time Series","","","SSA, LMY, IDA","Other (Facility)","Varies by data set, but generally includes rural-urban and provider type (public/private).","Three (Kenya, Tanzania, Senegal), with more to come.","","Education, Health","No Fixed Schedule","41468.0","41468.0","sdi@worldbank.org","Query tool","","0.0","Service Delivery Indicators, The World Bank","","http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/service-delivery-indicators","2010 - 2012",""

"1040.0","IFC Advisory Services Projects","","Private sector development requires more than just finance. Experience shows the powerful role advisory services can play in unlocking investment and helping businesses expand and create jobs.     To help the private sector in emerging markets, IFC provides advice, problem solving, and training to companies, industries, and governments. Our experience shows that companies need more than financial investment to thrive—they need a regulatory environment that enables entrepreneurship, and advice on business best practices. Our work includes advising national and local governments on how to improve their investment climate and strengthen basic infrastructure. Governments account for around half of our advisory projects. We also help investment clients improve corporate governance and become more sustainable.     We offer advice through nearly 1,100 Advisory Services staff in 85 offices across 73 countries. Funding comes from donor partners, IFC, and client contributions.
